### My Portfolio of Time Series Analysis

I will post my practices of time series analysis in this repo, most will be in jupyter notebooks, also with my reflections and summaries in markdown notes. 

Oh also, I am a beginner of R. I found that R provides powerful tools for statistics model (summary for dataset, model, fitting models, etc.) so I will try to solve some problems in R.

More materials coming soon :)
